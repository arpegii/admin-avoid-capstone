Chapter 1
Introduction
The importance of motorcycle-based delivery services within the logistics sector of the
Philippine industry is evident because it faces no substitute as the logistics solution can be said to
be the most flexible and economical when it comes to last-mile delivery in traffic and the
high-density urban settings of the Philippines. Their size, along with their agility, allows riders to
avoid the bottlenecks that usually stop the work of larger vehicles, so these vehicles are crucial in
response to the increasing role of e-commerce and on-demand delivery. But with this increment
in motorcycle delivery, there are big challenges in terms of operation. Riders are often exposed
to an unstable traffic flow, closure of roads, weather related damages e.g. flooding, which hinder
the routes and consequently result in high delays. Besides impacting customer satisfaction, these
problems cause inefficiency as well as enhance higher costs to be incurred by the logistics firms.
Besides, managers do not usually have tools that provide real-time information on exactly where
riders are, at what stage of delivery delays or other issues, so they cannot make informed
decisions and guarantee timely delivery of orders. Unless there is intelligent route design and
tracking, real-time tracking and open reporting channels, the delivery process will continue being
reactive and susceptible to preventable breakdowns.
In order to meet these urgent needs, the capstone project suggests the creation of an
Android-based all-purpose mobile and web application AVOID: Advanced Vehicle
Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch optimized to be used in a delivery business. The mobile
application will provide the riders with real-time navigation with weather responsive, and
traffic-aware rerouting on the A algorithm, flood-prone areas mapping, dynamic multi
destination planning that re-sequences stops by closest location to save time. Audio alerts will

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	6
keep the riders up to date with directions to follow and other traffic conditions and any possible
dangers. In the meantime, the dashboard of the web interface will supply managers with
real-time tracking of in-transit deliveries in form of GPS coordinates, a log of delivery histories,
profiles of riders with performance rating to manage incentive plans, and extensive statistics on
delivery schedules and areas of regular delays. AVOID offers multi-factor authentication,
role-based access to administration capabilities, heatmaps of violations, and exportable reports,
among other possibilities trying to change the nature of delivery management to a more proactive
one, rather than trying to solve problems and investigate incidents all the time. The system aims
to enhance logistics services with a guarantee of delivering reliability in urban areas in the
Philippines by empowering riders and administrators with real-time information and creative
capabilities to track on-time delivery success as well as efficiency.
Background of the Study
Motorcycle has emerged as a mainstream mode of transport in the Philippines with more
than 7.8 million registered motor cycles and tricycles in the year 2023 alone (Statista, 2024).
They are so popular thanks mostly to their low prices, fuel consumption, and ease of
maneuvering in congested city roads in the country. Such strengths have positioned motorcycles
as the mainstay of city of last mile deliveries and logistical activities in cities such as Metro
Manila and Antipolo. Growth in delivery services involving motorcycles has been on a faster
pace as of late due to the multiplication of motorcycle taxi services like Angkas, JoyRide, and
Move It since 2016 (Rosales, 2024). This growth has led to an even more competitive
environment within the sphere of logistics, with the prompt and flawless delivery of parcels often
being the key to meeting the expectations of the customers and remaining profitable in the work
of the company in question.

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	7
Nevertheless, in addition to the factors contributing to the appealing nature of
motorcycles as a means of logistics, speed, maneuverability, and densely-metered urban traffic,
these operational issues also create major impediments. Delivery riders are also faced with much
fluctuating traffic, small or busy roads, and limited routes which may consequently result in
delayed delivery, and late customer time windows. Planning the routes is further complicated by
external environmental conditions like unpredictable weather, urban floods when it is pouring
heavily, etc. that can cause the need to go through unexpected detours or halt (Topnatch
Logistics, 2023). These concerns have first-hand effects on service reliability provided by
logistics companies, as well as leading to escalating costs due to time loss associated with it, fuel
costs and graver effects that happen to the reputability of logistics companies. The failure in
timely and quality last-mile delivery will leave an ever-spreading impact in the supply chain and
undercut the effectiveness of overall logistics and customer confidence.
In addition to the traffic and environmental barriers, there is another issue ensuring the
successful real-time control and supervision of the delivery riders. Most logistics processes do
not have a single system that can track the location of the riders in real-time, document the
current delivery status, and assess the frequent reasons why it is delayed. In the absence of an
accurate picture of live rider data, dispatch and supervisor teams find it hard to manage their
fleets, reposition tasks on a real-time basis, and proactively catch up with route upheaval.
Existing solutions can exist, but despite the basic GPS tracking or navigation they are not able to
implement the significant features on the logistics side e.g. weather-based rerouting, multiple
stop deliveries optimization, or integration with the warehouse dispatch. Consequently, logistics
companies, notably the smaller ones, often use manual techniques of coordination or disjointed
tools that are ineffective to implement as the demand rises.

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	8
This research proposes to develop AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and
Intelligent Dispatch, which is a mobile and web-based system to support motorcycle delivery
operation in the Philippines. The android mobile will have real-time navigation using the GPS
and smart rerouting by use of A* algorithm which makes it give dynamic rerouting based on the
traffic and the flood-prone regions. It will have flood display maps, stop-delivery route planning,
and auto re-sequencing (destination order-based on proximity) as well as voice-based alerts to
guide the users to follow the direct routes through a dense urban set up. How to ride safely and
road rules will also be integrated in the educative contents which will be supporting rider
readiness. The web-admin dashboard will enable the logistics managers to view an overview of
the location of the riders in realtime, as well as log of deliveries made, violation notification and
delivery status which can be either in delivered, delayed or in transit status, and perform
analytics in heatmap view and reports. AVOID will allow the logistics operators to anticipate and
control the delivery process, minimize delays, and spend less time attracting riders to adhere to
safe and efficient routes and eventually deliver superior customer experience with multi-factor
authentication, role-based access control, and robust reporting functions.
Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement AVOID: Advanced
Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch, an Android-based mobile and web application
that assists motorcycle riders in following traffic regulations through real-time alerts and
provides administrators with tools to monitor rider behavior and delivery performance.
Specifically, the study aims to:
● To design a mobile app with real-time GPS navigation, A route planning, and multi-stop
delivery, accounting for traffic and flood-prone areas.

-- 8 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	9
● To enable rerouting to provide safer delivery routes in weather-conscious, flood-avoidant
routes is made possible.
● To give clear voice instructions and warnings in the matters of prohibitions of the road
like no overtaking places and one-way directions.
● To contain educational information about safe driving and road-specific rules of driving
delivery.
● To develop a secure web dashboard to track the real time location of the vehicle, create
logs of trips, track the delivery status, and monitor the performance.
● To adopt the multi-factor authentication and role-based access to the system security.
● Evaluate the overall system based on ISO 25010 software quality standards: Functional
Suitability, Performance Efficiency,Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Maintainability,
and Portability.
Significance of the Study
The proposed AVOID (Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch) project
holds substantial importance by providing a practical and real-time intervention to mitigate
traffic violations committed by motorcycle operators through mobile alert functionalities.
Motorcycle Riders: Riders are anticipated to experience enhanced road safety and
cultivate heightened situational awareness. Provision of real-time warnings in relation to traffic
signs and speed limits, as well as the contemporary road regulations, will enable them to avoid
the occurrence of violations that are not intended, thus leading to a decrease in the number of
accidents occurring and enhancing a safer commuting process.
Logistics Companies and Delivery Operations: AVOID aids effective route scheduling
and checks on delays in delivery and driver patterns. This may result in better reliability of the

-- 9 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	10
deliveries, transparency of operations, and, possibly, an incentive program available to
high-performing riders.
Traffic Authorities and Policy Makers: The information based on the collected data
(e.g., app logs, certain areas with committing violations) and the success of any real-time alerting
tools could help develop traffic control, city planning, and a more specific campaign/public
safety intervention to be created to control road behavior better and decrease congestion.
ICT Sector and Developers: The project can be of immense value to the ICT
community as it shows how real-time location monitoring, a dynamic route planning with A*
algorithm, flooding-prone areas visualization, and multi-factor authorization could be combined
together in a single application. The design and approach can be used by ICT professionals and
researchers to develop more superior, user-oriented, as well as responsive transport and logistics
management systems.
Scope of the Study

distribution
● Incentive Tracker
○ Displays the frequency of riders scoring above 90 to help determine eligibility for
rewards
A logistics warehouse in Antipolo will be involved along with the study and it will also
specifically focus on the delivery routes in Brgy. Mayamot, Cupang and Mambugan.
Delimitation
The application is limited to the following functions:
● The Android app will be designed exclusively to work with Android handsets and will
not work with either iOS-based or other operating systems.

-- 12 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	13
● The system is set to guide the riders and remind them of the traffic rules in real life, but
does not identify and confirm the real traffic violations made by the rider.
● It will contain only some traffic regulations (e.g. speed limits, zones of safety, zones of no
overtaking, zones of pedestrians); the system does not contain the entire list of traffic
regulations.
● Weather-based rerouting and flood-prone area visualization depend on integration with
external weather APIs and databases.
● Real-time GPS tracking, traffic conditions, flood-prone areas visualization, and the
synchronization of data with Supabase all need an active connection to the internet.
● The application is not used to track the accuracy of driving, settle penalties, or confirm
the compliance of the driver.
● The system is designed for the riders in the J&T motorcycles. It has no association to the
other types of delivery services (like Toktok) and cannot work on three-wheeled vehicles
(like the Bajaj or other tricycles).
● It is spatially constrained as the pilot implementation is in Brgy. Mayamot, Cupang, and
Mambugan in Antipolo City, in partnership with a local warehouse logistics.
● Delivery status and timeliness are the only two factors that are used to determine the
scoring and rewarding system in the company.

Chapter 2
Theoretical Framework
This chapter contains details on previous research that is related to the creation of
AVOID: Real-time Road Rules Mobile Application Guide, which is aimed at helping J&T
motorcycle riders. The project is conducted in the sphere of traffic safety, motorcycle rider
behavior, the real-time location-based system, and the development of a mobile application. The
notions help to achieve the objective of the study to enable safer driving by giving adequate road
rule advice and warnings to motorcycle riders.
Review of Related Literature
Motorcycles have become one of the most widely used modes of transport in the
Philippines, with more than 7.8 million units registered nationwide in 2023 (Balita, 2025). This
widespread use extends beyond personal travel, with many logistics firms such as J&T Express
depending on motorcycle riders for timely last-mile delivery services. While this has improved
accessibility and delivery reach, it has also introduced a set of issues related to traffic law
compliance, road safety, and delivery efficiency.

-- 14 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	15
Data from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) revealed that
motorcycle drivers are among the most frequent traffic violators. Out of the 20,656 recorded
traffic offenses 4,527 or 21.92% of those involved, were motorcycle riders who were using the
lanes that were not designated for motorcycles (Mendoza, 2023). Also, during a given period of
enforcement, more than 20,000 traffic violations were documented with many of them being
motorcycle riders abusing lanes that are not supposed to be used by them (Rosales, 2024). These
violations may lead to parcel delays and an adverse effect on the customer satisfaction level,
which is specifically relevant to such logistic businesses as J&T Express, which specialises in
delivery parcels.

-- 15 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	16
A contributing factor to these problems is the lack of formal traffic education among
riders. According to research by Villanueva et al. (2024), many Filipino motorcycle drivers learn
road rules through informal methods or peer instruction rather than formal training. This
incomplete knowledge base leads to frequent traffic violations, especially among younger and
less experienced riders. Beltran et al. (2022) also observed that this demographic were the ones
to struggle with understanding the basic traffic signs, leading to their chances of violations
during delivery tasks to increase. Even with the introduction of programs like the No Contact
Apprehension Program (NCAP), traffic violations remain high. In just one month following its
reimplementation, over 24,000 traffic sign violations were recorded (Malonzo, 2025). The most
common offenses were the violation of posted signs, mostly committed unknowingly due to a
lack of rider awareness (Rosales, 2024). Reports have shown thousands of violations in the
weeks following NCAP’s reinstatement, underscoring persistent noncompliance and a gap
between regulation and actual rider behavior (Zurbano, 2025) These continued violations
highlight the need for educational tools and a guidance system to support better compliance
during deliveries.
Weather conditions are another major challenge for motorcycle riders and the logistics
area. Flooding, heavy rains, and typhoons usually disrupt the normal delivery routes, placing
riders and their motorcycle at risk and delaying their parcel deliveries. Topnatch Logistics (2024)
noted that unpredictable weather patterns consistently affect shipment reliability across the
country. As a result, there has been a growing need for logistics tools that incorporate flood
detection, dynamic navigation, and smarter route planning to prevent delays and ensure safety.

-- 16 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	17
In response to these problems, the researchers proposed the AVOID mobile application
which is designed specifically to support logistics riders from J&T Express. The system offers
real-time alerts tied to the rider’s current location, including information about speed regulations,
one-way restrictions, areas that prohibit overtaking, and flood-prone areas. It also includes
educational content on traffic signs and corresponding penalties to improve compliance and
understanding among users. This design follows principles in human-computer interaction,
which emphasize the effectiveness of delivering location-based feedback to shape user behavior
(Galang et al., 2020).
The reviewed studies clearly show that the delivery riders in logistics areas face a lot of
different difficulties, ranging from bad road rule knowledge to weather disruptions that can cause
them to have delays in delivery. AVOID is seeking to address these issues through a combination
of real-time data, map visualization, and user education. Similar applications in other fields have
already proved the impact of a system in improving decision-making and reducing human error.
With these functions tailored specifically for J&T Motorcycle riders, AVOID presents a solution
to support safer and more efficient delivery practices for J&T Express motorcycle riders.

the Philippines (no-overtaking area, one-way area, and flood-prone streets), common patterns
and violation behaviors of motorcycle riders in the J&T company, and technical requirements to
implement the system including Flutter, APIs (Map and Weather), Visual Studio Code, and
Supabase compatible Android systems with GPS and internet access.

Its development is according to a Rapid Application Development (RAD) model, which
entails four major steps, viz., Requirements Planning, User Design, System Construction, and
Cutover (Transition to Use). In Requirements Planning, the delivery issues in reality like
incorrect pins, prohibited areas and flooded areas are studied, and the experience of riders is
collected. User Design envisaged easy destination pinning using the interface, computation of a
shortest path, and real-time traffic warnings involving restricted areas as well as a switch
allowing flood-based rerouting to be freely enabled or disabled. The admin dashboard would also
be set to have live tracking of the GPS and delivery.
The mobile app is developed in the Construction phase comprising integrated Map API,
Weather API, where shortest-path calculation is made, and limited zone validation done along
with riders alerting in real-time. Admin web dashboard is designed to show in real-time the
locations of riders, past delivery records, and violation history including suspension
management. In the Cutover stage, the system is piloted and implemented and feedback provided
by users is taken to improve systems such as pin validation systems, restricted zone warning, and
the ability to reroute.
The AVOID system currently has as its final output a completed fully working mobile
application of the J&T delivery riders with shortest path guidance, notifying of the traffic rules in
real time, optionally performing flood aware rerouting, and providing rider feedback report.
There is a live GPS tracking, violation tracking, and the delivery log activity that is administered
through the admin web dashboard. On the whole, the project will provide safer activities of
delivery work and minimize traffic violations and delays due to better routing and monitoring
compliance.

System Architecture
Figure 2
System Architecture of AVOID
Figure 2 comprises three major components, namely, Presentation Tier, Logic Tier, and
Data Tier. The Presentation Tier is the place where users and administrators communicate with
the system. To users this is composed of the mobile application whereby the user can access the
content which includes location tracking, and pop up alerts for warnings of violation on road
rules. With the user-friendly interface, the riders will get real-time alerts using pop-up
notifications with voice commands, flood-prone locations, and will be likely to use navigation
functionalities. The dashboard (web) gives access to system data to the administrators so that the
activities of users could be monitored, thus making the oversight and analysis really efficient.
The Logic Tier does all processing and organization of applications features. This level does the
real time GPS navigation, alert, and processing of data which runs the functionalities of the

-- 20 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	21
application. The APIs used in this layer are used as mediators between the presentation layer and
the data layer. This level makes sure that users get information in time, functions of voice
commands, observation of the behavior and location of a rider to enhance safety and traffic rules
adherence.
Data Tier is involved in the storage and retrieval of the data. It is blowing all the vital
records, including location logs, road rules data, and alerts. The logic layer gets access to such
information and transmits it back to the presentation layer which visualizes it and makes
decisions. Also the data stored is fed to the admin dashboard, thus easy monitoring and reporting
of the system is possible.

Chapter 3
Research Methodology
This project mainly aims to design and develop AVOID: an Android mobile application,
which would give motorcyclists real-time location-based traffic law information and routes. The
system will also facilitate road safety and compliance by the riders, especially those within the
Philippines as the results can be obtained immediately via the app.
Project Design
The study uses a Developmental Research Design structure which the researcher shall
attempt to design, construct and test AVOID, being a mobile Android application. This project is
specifically designed to be implemented to J&T motorcycle delivery riders where they are given

-- 23 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	24
real-time and location-based advice on the set of chosen rules on traffic and optimized routes in
order to make safer and more efficient deliveries in the pilot localities of Brgy. Mayamot,
Cupang and Mambugan in Antipolo City.
AVOID is to assist the riders by providing prompt instructions in a simple understandable
way, in real-time, with regards to major traffic rules that are applicable to their route, i.e.,
no-overtaking zones (e.g., bridges, curves), one-way streets, and pedestrian areas. The system is
not about identifying and confirming real violations but precedently gives riders
recommendations so that they do not make various mistakes. It is based on built-in GPS tracking
and third-party APIs (maps and weather) to compute and display the most efficient route and
ensure a route is not blocked.
In addition to safety and efficiency, the optional flood-aware rerouting functionality is
also incorporated in the app since it allows riders to decide that they do not wish to route to
flood-prone areas, based on weather predictions and on local hazard information sets. The riders
are also allowed to pin their delivery location where the system will automatically calculate the
best route within the shortest time and in line with compliance. Voice messages and real-time
warnings will be pop-up to warn of any restrictions or dangers ahead.
More than just guiding the riders through, AVOID has the integrated feedback aspect that
the riders can provide to report on wrong pins or confusing signages that will enable further
enhancement on the accuracy of the route. Management has its own web-based admin dashboard
that shows the real-time GPS position of active riders, previous delivery reports, and documented
violation notifications that help J&T manage its operation.
Some important user management functionality of the app are secure access, account
management, password reset, and history page of the previous alerts received. This enables riders

-- 24 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	25
to review their delivery routes and warnings, supporting ongoing learning and improved
compliance.
Altogether, the project is restricted to the Android-based devices, targeting motor vehicle
riders (not three-wheeled vehicles or other companies offers such as Toktok), and usable by J&T
Express within the targeted pilot area. It focuses on on-road assistance and routing, not actual
enforcement, determining of violations, or comprehensive evaluation of driving behavior,
preferring to prevent delivery delays and increase the safety of riders through preemptive and
convenient assistance.

Requirement
Needs active internet connection to communicate in real time
location based notifications, as well as information coordination
with Supabase.
Core Functionality
Scope
Its basic use is to give users alerts and notes in real time based on
the location in regards to traffic regulations and navigation systems.
Rule Coverage 	Deals only with certain rules in the road (e.g. speed limit zone,
single traffic, safety zones, flood-prone areas).
Behavioral Impact 	Attempts to generate awareness and remind about it in a timely
manner in the future; it fails to directly assume the ability to
manipulate and measure actual driving behavior.
Hardware Dependencies Needs Android Smartphone that has a GPS module and Internet
Connectivity.
Database Integration 	Uses Supabase to store and maintain historical alerts and
application usage records.
Table 2 shows the AVOID mobile application has the limitation in terms of platform
(Android only), and it can only work with a running internet connection and Supabase data. It
also does not enforce any road rule, but acts only as a location-based reminder of specified road
rules, and its effects on behavior is restricted to that of awareness and informed decision making,
as it is hardware dependent on a GPS activated Android smartphone.

Steps in Creating Data Models

-- 30 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	31
Figure 3 shows initialization of user data is the initial step within the workflow of an
AVOID system. After the installation of the application, users establish accounts by setting up
accounts with details that contain username and password, device details, and preferences. Upon
the user becoming active, the system will start capturing the real-time data of the user based on
their location, and this is key when determining the current location of the rider. This information
is then compared with pre-programmed rules or the road and alert areas in the database. In case
of match detection, the system will issue contextual warnings like speed restrictions, roadside
markers, or no passing zones, and these are sent out as a pop-up on the phone or as a program.
Each of those events that cause the alerts to fire is stored in the Alert_History table to be
tracked and evaluated. Such warnings are meant to alert the rider according to their current
location and make sure that they remember the road requirements. In the meantime, there is a
knowledge base of traffic rules in the application, with access to visual graphics of familiar
traffic signs, their description, and respective penalties, which can be viewed and learnt by a user
at their discretion. Each operation of the user in the app is stored in the Usage_Log, making it
possible to trace a trend in user behaviour and system performance by developers and traffic
authorities. This data model will assist to make sure that the AVOID system is not just an app
that gives out alerts but also creates long-term awareness and compliance of motorcyclists.

Design Discussion
AVOID is an android application with its complementary web-based administrative tool,
which was developed to enhance the safety and operating efficiency of J&T motorcycle delivery
riders in the pilot districts of Brgy. Mayamot, Cupang and Mambugan in the city of Antipolo,
Philippines. The app also offers real-time and place-based advice to guide the riders to avoid the
usual road hazards and abide by the traffic regulations of their choice, including no-overtaking
lanes on bridges and bends, one-way roads, and pedestrian zones. In contrast to such
enforcement systems that only authenticate violations, AVOID is a proactive warning system
which provides a preliminary warning to the riders thus averting violations. Its major mobile

-- 39 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	40
capacities are safe registration and log in, map pinning with shortest route routing, multiple map
layers, including flood prone area graphic representation, and optional flood aware toggle
rerouting of live weather conditions. The riders will also be have pop-up and audio alerts in real
time that indicate upcoming restrictions or danger and also have the option of giving feedback on
inaccurate pins or confusing signs to increase the accuracy of the system.
The administrative dashboard is in aid of the operations of J&T to track active riders in
real-time using the capabilities of GPS trackers, historical deliveries that contain logs and the
routes of deliveries, as well as violation notifications that are issued by the system to review the
operations. Admins are able to control the rider accounts, monitor the performance of the
delivery, as well as suspend controls. Both mobile app and dashboard are highly usable and
visually consistent so that riders and non-technical users could access it simply. Technically,
AVOID uses GPS modules, mapping APIs and integration of weather APIs to achieve the
functionality through the secure and scaling than Supabase data storage asset. AVOID will
minimize potential delivery delays and opportunity to increase road safety of J&T motorcycle
riders by providing convenient, accessible, and smart route support that is proactive and
real-time as an alternative to punitive real-time monitoring.
Project Development
The figure shows the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model comprising four (4)
major steps, namely Requirements Planning, User Design, Construction, and Cutover. All the
stages play a crucial role in the evolution of the AVOID system, which is a mobile application
that helps motorcyclists receive real-time traffic warnings and location-based assistance to help
them travel more securely. The use of GPS technology and backend development with Supabase

-- 40 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	41
facilitates streamlined data management of the app. This is how each RAD step facilitates the
development of the AVOID application (see Figure 17):
Figure 15
Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model
Figure 15 shows Requirements Planning. This initial step aimed to determine the
information on user needs that was collected and elicited in the context of designing the AVOID
mobile application, which responds to current traffic situations and road regulations in real-time.
Its main capabilities were identified, among which include real-time warnings of speed limits,
directions to one-ways, and safety zones, depending on locations. Additional features such as
multi-destination auto-reordering, flood-prone area visualization, and pop-up voice alerts for
pedestrian zones and no-overtaking areas were also outlined. Feedback was also taken
concerning user management features, and details on storing information and data in Supabase
and usability, efficiency, and security demands. Multi-factor authentication was planned to
ensure secure access for both riders and admins.
User Design Phase. In this phase, prototypes were created for the AVOID mobile
application's interface and alert presentation. The mobile application was developed through

-- 41 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	42
Flutter to offer an intuitive visual and in-app notification experience, real-time updates, and user
control. User screens were designed to show flood visualizations, route optimization options, and
traffic regulation reminders using HERE Maps and OSM API integrations. The two-way
communication between the front-end of the application and the Supabase backend, including
the location service, was both developed and optimized to guarantee the responsiveness and the
reliability of the prompt alerts delivery. The inclusion of an educational content module covering
all major road rules was refined during this stage. User feedback played a significant role in
optimizing the interface and interaction flow of the app to be clear and effective for
motorcyclists.
Construction Phase. The AVOID application and its integrated system components were
constructed and coded during this phase. The Android application was built using the Flutter
framework and the Dart programming language. Logic was developed and adjusted to ensure
accurate real-time location monitoring, precise rule identification, and timely alert triggering
based on GPS data and integrated road rule information. Additional construction was made to
integrate pop-up alerts with voice commands, support multi-destination routing, and connect
incentive-based scoring features. The setup was secure, reliable, and resilient due to the
comprehensive coding and testing of the system to support effective contextual reminders and
user information using Supabase APIs.
Cutover Phase. The last stage was testing and system deployment. The effectiveness of
the AVOID application was confirmed by its field testing in the rush hour conditions, especially
in the predetermined zones of Antipolo City, Rizal. Using feedback from test users, the accuracy
in raising alerts, the user friendliness of the interface, and the user experience have been greatly
enhanced. Again, before the preliminary deployment took place, final checks and adjustments

-- 42 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	43
were done on the system so that the evaluation phase could begin. AVOID system was developed
by use of the RAD methodology, which is fast and user-centered. This enabled the group to
prototype at a fast pace, solicit feedback, and test iteratively the elements of the mobile app and
the back-end integration. The repetitive procedures also determined that the end product was not
just reliable and helpful but also easy to incorporate by individuals into their riding schedules.
The admin dashboard with rider monitoring, violation scoring, daily quota tracking, and
CSV/PDF report generation was also finalized during this stage. To sum it up, the use of the
RAD approach allowed us to create a more responsive and user-friendly mobile application,
which better fits the current reality in terms of road safety within the circuits belonging to
motorcyclists.
Testing and Operating Procedures
AVOID mobile application will be tested by selected J&T motorcycle riders, who
regularly drive through different areas in Antipolo City. These testers are our partners and are
chosen because they operate motorcycles daily and are often exposed to road signs, traffic rules,
and unpredictable traffic conditions, making them ideal for evaluating our application's
effectiveness and usability.
For the testers to be able to operate the application, the testers will download the AVOID
app onto their Android smartphones. The application will then run with real-time GPS tracking,
providing location-based alerts on traffic signs, road rules, speed limits, and flood-prone areas.
Testers will have access to the following features:
● Real-time navigation with dynamic route adjustments
● Notifications for traffic regulations
● An informational section on road rules and penalties

-- 43 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	44
● User profiles with ride history logs
● Map overlays highlighting areas susceptible to flooding
● Pop-up voice alerts
● Multi-destination route planning with automatic reordering
Key areas of evaluation during testing:
● System Speed: Timeliness and precision of alerts and map refreshes while riding
● App Stability: Smooth operation across various Android models
● Ease of Use: Rider familiarity with app navigation and functionality
● Satisfaction Level: How beneficial and enjoyable the app is for users
● Adaptability: How effectively the app responds to changing routes, traffic, and hazard
zones.
User input will guide enhancements to the app’s dependability, interface, bug fixes, and
GPS alert efficiency. Regular updates will be rolled out throughout testing to maintain optimal
performance during active rides.
Project Evaluation
The AVOID system was quantified based on ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model that
has eight primary characteristics to determine qualities of software. Functional suitability,
performance efficiency, usability, reliability, and maintainability are the most appropriate
qualities in this project.
The functional suitability is also very crucial because AVOID will have to correctly trace
the real-time location of riders and provide them with alerts regarding existing traffic regulations
on the go; that is, it needs to communicate on-time about one-way streets, no-overtaking zones,
and pedestrian areas. The system needs to react immediately to the variation of the position and

-- 44 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	45
orientation of the riders and give them understandable and clear warnings, whether in form of
pop-up notifications or voice messages. Other solutions, like planning shortest-route, the
possibility to plan the route with potential re-route basing on the weather forecasts, and real-time
hazard alerts are additional components that reinforce the functional objectives of the app.
It is also necessary to have performance efficiency due to the necessity of working with
the continuous GPS tracking, fast access to the rule information, but with the ability to remain
responsive to the user within the restricted mobile signal range or with mobile device limitations.
AVOID utilizes the services of HERE Maps, Overpass Turbo, and Supabase, which provide the
opportunity to offer dynamic routing, a visual representation of areas at risk of floods, and
smooth synchronization of data without delays, which requires regularization of the rider traffic
safety.
The particular focus into usability is due to the target audience of the app who is a
motorcycle rider and therefore would require fast and unfettered and focused interaction. The
interface is largely intuitive and clean, and the alerts are easy to read, allowing voice assistance
to control the system hands-free and easy navigation and pin the destinations and review the
routes. The application should be easy to run and the users with less technical expertise should
learn little before they can operate it.
Dependability is a critical element in ensuring proper and consistent performance despite
the long deliveries and changing weather sets. AVOID will provide reliable real-time alerts to
prevent crash or inaccuracy. Proper GPS mapping of the various types of roads in the city of
Antipolo and flood-prone area transparencies, means that the system can be used even by riders
in the real world as well as during extreme weather events.

-- 45 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	46
Sustainability of the project also focuses on maintainability. When AVOID is scaled up to
cover an increased number of traffic regulations or even other platforms such as the iOS, the
code base being written in a modular design philosophy based in Flutter and Supabase will
ensure updates and allow addition of features easily in future. With this method, the extension of
the system can be carried out to further the level of details in the dashboards created
administratively and rule database, or tracking module of incentive without having to undertake a
complete renewal.
Although the issues of security and compatibility always matter, they are less relevant in
this case. Performances in terms of security requirements are aimed at protecting basic user
credentials through secure authentication processes. The compatibility is already limited to
Android devices, as it fits the prospective users of J&T motorbike delivery riders in pilot regions.
Finally, assessing AVOID in the bounds of ISO 25010 family of standards, the app can be
noted as having the significant provision in terms of functionality, performance, usability,
reliability, and maintainability. This helps it in achieving its mission to provide practical,
real-time and easy-to-use support to J&T riders such that they avoid mishaps on the roads of the
city of Antipolo and, in turn, help the company deliver goods efficiently and that riders are safe.

Done On-going To-do
Potential for Commercialization
The AVOID project was created to assist the rapidly growing population of motorcycle
riders by offering a real-time guidance solution that enhances road safety, promotes compliance,
and ultimately reduces traffic violations. With over 7.8 million registered motorcycles and
tricycles in the Philippines (Balita, 2025), and the increasing prevalence of motorcycle taxi and
delivery services such as J&T Express, it aims to significantly improve daily commuting and
delivery safety. Some of the challenges which the application deals with include informal
training of riders and the inability of riders to remember complicated traffic regulations amidst
changing environments, hence providing early warnings and reminders.
We are working with the J&T warehouse at Brgy. Mambugan, Antipolo City, Rizal, with
delivery areas extending as far as Brgy. Cupang and Brgy. Mayamot, which offer an excellent
test site in real-life situations. This will prove that the solution will work well in a region with
high motorcycle traffic and complex road conditions.
Although it has a high commercial value due to the tremendous market of the target
audience, as it has been defined in TAM-SAM-SOM analysis, the primary objective of the
project is to bring about an effective and affordable solution that could help the common Filipino
motorcycle riders. The AVOID application is also scalable and can be customized to serve the
whole J&T company. Commercialization may follow as a result of partnerships, licensing, or
bulk deployment for fleet management. However, our team prioritizes functionality, accessibility,
and social impact over immediate profit.

Quezon City, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology students, is designed to empower

-- 50 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	51
motorcycle riders across the Philippines by providing measurable advancements in road safety
and compliance during dynamic traffic conditions.
The system will be auto location-based alerting in real-time that will automatically
provide vital reminders of traffic signs, speed limit conditions, and lane guidance with direct
action to decrease unintended violations and anxiety in the rider. Such proactive performance
capabilities aim at making the occurrence of traffic violations and the possibility of accidents
rather unlikely.
The addition of flood-prone area visualizations, voice-based alerts, and multi-destination
route optimization also extends the benefit of the application by helping reduce delivery delays
and detours. Riders will be better equipped to navigate difficult road conditions and remain
compliant with traffic laws.
The user feedback will be obtained through the information collected on forms of
standardized surveys (e.g., System Usability Scale, Technology Acceptance Model) and through
analyzing the application usage logs in the Supabase storage. The efficiency and timeliness of the
location-based alerting systems, such as the specificity of identifying a traffic sign and rule
enforcement, will be strictly tested using predetermined performance attributes by the
documentation of the ISO/IEC 25010, Functionality, and Performance Efficiency attributes.
These aspects of the AVOID app, as seen on the user side, including delivering alert
information in real-time and handling user interaction, will be assessed through the rate of user
acceptance and the level of overall user satisfaction, which correlates with the attribute of
Usability as provided in ISO/IEC 25010. The decision to use the Flutter development framework
would likely enhance efficiency in the project by facilitating a powerful application with optimal
timeframes and code reusability.

-- 51 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	52
The fact that Supabase provides data handling functions with high reliability in the safe
management of user and alert logs, together with the fact that there will be shorter development
cycles due to the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model of development, will also be
used to quantify the overall success of this project.
Additionally, the app’s built-in scoring and delivery tracking system, including rider
performance logs, daily quota completion, and incentive thresholds, will provide measurable
indicators of behavior change and compliance improvement among J&T riders.
Finally, AVOID will create itself as an effective and efficient solution to solving common
motorcycle traffic law violations and towards the safety of the roads by the riders in the
Philippines. This smartphone app aims to be a workable, effective solution to the problem of
traversing complicated traffic situations with the motorcycle commuters of the Philippines as the
main beneficiaries.

Business Model
The Business Model Canvas of the AVOID project, as well as the given strategy of its
implementation, fully reinforces its feasibility and desirability. The system can provide an
apparatus of twofold value: by offering riders increased safety and decreased potential of traffic
distraction caused by work-crippled turnarounds. One can easily visualize a flood-prone area or

-- 54 of 59 --

AVOID: Advanced Vehicle Optimization and Intelligent Dispatch 	55
optimize the most efficient multi-stop route or get pop-up voice alerts, and these features are the
most helpful in the unpredictable driving environment, so the platform is likely to become very
popular among delivery riders working in a densely populated area or where weather conditions
are likely to change.
Strategic alliances The strategic alliances especially with the J&T warehouse in Brgy.
Mambugan, Antipolo Cityenhance the AVOID deployment and make sure that there is constant
feedback by the actual users. Such partnerships make it possible to make successive upgrades
and customized features, which suit ground realities.
Its business model lays its focus on the stable service and thoughtless user experience.
The core costs will be spent on the app development, backend infrastructure on Supabase and
future marketing plans. The key actions are the updating of Android application created in
Flutter, keeping the information about traffic rules actual, as well as providing user support and
synchronicity of the data.
The most significant resources are our specially designed traffic regulation database,
routing and location algorithms, team of dedicated developers, and Supabase backend system.
The value proposition of the system, which focuses on the increased level of safety, reduced
number of violations and peace of mind, is up to the mark with the target users of the system.
Despite the availability of core features without a fee, the riders are likely to use the app because
of the objective benefits of undertaking it. The bottom line is that AVOID is a potential, scalable,
and effective proposal to combat road safety and delivery efficiency by the riders of motorbikes
in the Philippines.
